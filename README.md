# Research
My research focuses on how people make forward-looking decisions over systems that they don't completely control, primarily ecosystem and epidemiological systems. Two current areas were I am focused are how natural assets can and should be valued for the purposes of national balance sheets and where does nature capitalize into financial systems.

# Opportunities
## Post docs
I anticipate starting to search for post docs for the AY starting fall 2025 soon. I will look for people with strong backgrounds in economics and understanding of ecological systems.
## PhD students
I am not currently anticipating bring on a new PhD student in fall 2025, but will make a final decision about this in October or November 2024.
## Master's Students
Please start with the Yale YSE admissions office.
